## Overview

**flashy** is a mobile-first flashcard app. It is built with React in the frontend and Rails in the backend. After signing up, users can create and modify their own flashcards, which are organized into decks. Flashcards can be used for increasing their vocabulary or remembering terms and concepts in a specific subject.

## MVP

> The Minimum Viable Product should be a well-planned, easily-communicated product, ensuring that the client's deliverable will be achievable and meet specifications within the time frame estimated.

_The **Project Title** MVP lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus dapibus fermentum risus vitae bibendum. Integer vel ipsum mollis odio sollicitudin ornare eu vel ex. In quis fringilla velit, ac maximus quam. Etiam eget placerat neque. Aenean faucibus sem non nisi lobortis ullamcorper._

<br>

### Goals

Backend
- Build a Ruby on Rails server with RESTful JSON endpoints
- Build a database with three tables: users, decks, words
* user to decks is one to many, decks to words is many to many
* full CRUD controller methods for the words and decks tables

Frontend
- React app with at least 8 separate rendered components
- Consume data from Ruby on Rails backend and render data in React components
- Enable full CRUD on the frontend for decks and words within those decks
- Use CSS Flexbox and/or Grid
- Implement media queries for smartphone, tablet, and desktop

### Libraries and Dependencies

|     Library      | Description                                |
| :--------------: | :----------------------------------------- |
| React Router DOM | Enables linking and routing to different components |
|      Axios       | Sends asynchronous HTTP requests to RESTful endpoints to perform CRUD on database |
|    PostgreSQl    | Imported as 'pg' in Rails, sets postgresql as the database for Active Record |
|    rack-cors     | Handles cross-origin resource sharing, makes cross-origin AJAX possible |

### Client (Front End)

#### Wireframes

> Use the Wireframes section to display desktop, tablet and mobile views. No hand-drawn wireframes. Use a tool like wireframe.cc, Whimsical or AdobeXD

#### Component Tree

> Use this section to display the structure of how your React components are being rendered. This should show the parent to child relation between you components. In other words, show which components are rendering the other components. Include a link to your component tree

[Component Tree Sample](https://gist.git.generalassemb.ly/davidtwhitlatch/414107e2560ae0bb65e233570f2fe056#file-component-tree-png)

#### Component Architecture

> Use this section to define your React components and the data architecture of your app. This should be a reflection of how you expect your directory/file tree to look like. 

``` structure

src
|__ assets/
      |__ fonts
      |__ graphics
      |__ images
      |__ mockups
|__ components/
      |__ Header.jsx
|__ services/

```

#### Time Estimates

> Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out each of the components you've described above.

| Task                | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| ------------------- | :------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| Add Contact Form    |    L     |     3 hrs      |     2 hrs     |    3 hrs    |
| Create CRUD Actions |    H     |     3 hrs      |     1 hrs     |     TBD     |
| TOTAL               |          |     6 hrs      |     3 hrs     |     TBD     |

> _Why is this necessary? Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evaluate possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe._

### Server (Back End)

#### ERD Model

> Use this section to display an image of a computer generated ERD model. You can use draw.io, Lucidchart or another ERD tool.
